        <p class="logo-HP">Check out the new LEGO Harry Potter Gringotts Wizarding Bank set</p>

        <p class="tiket-description-info">This latest LEGO® set invites you to build Diagon Alley's iconic wizarding
            bank Gringotts, complete with 13 minifigures and the Ukranian Ironbelly Dragon.</p>
        <p class="tiket-description-info"><b>Gringotts is known as one of the most intricate and cleverly designed<br>
                locations across all of the wizarding world, comprised of underground<br> tunnels and secret vaults.
                Now, you
                can celebrate the dazzling details of the<br> bank with this brand new upcoming LEGO® set, which uses
                4,803<br>
                pieces! (So be careful when you're hoovering!)</b></p>
        <p class="tiket-description-info"><b>Fans will be able to build the grandiose white exterior of Gringotts, the
                main <br>banking hall, and of course, the best bit: the mysterious underground vaults,<br> which come
                with a
                mine-cart rollercoaster ride. You may remember<br> Hagrid and Harry once took the plunge on this cart in
                the
                very first<br> Harry Potter film.</b></p>
        <img src="./images/Lego-HP.png">
        <p class="tiket-description-info"><b>The Gringotts set also encompasses some of the adventures from the later
            <br>Harry Potter stories, such as the epic break-in (and break-out!) that Harry, Ron <br>and Hermione
                (all
                included as minifigures!) achieve during Harry Potter and <br>the Deathly Hallows. This means that
                you'll
                get your very own Ukranian<br>Ironbelly Dragon as part of this set, who is freed by<br>the golden
                trio.</b><br>
        </p>
        <p class="tiket-description-info"><b>Other minifigures include Rubeus Hagrid, Bellatrix Lestrange, Griphook and
            <br>various goblin bankers and guards, meaning you can build your very own <br>Gringotts andhave your own
                adventures. It's definitely more exciting than our<br> Muggle banks!</b><br>
        </p>
        <p class="tiket-description-info"><b>The LEGO® Harry Potter™ Gringotts Wizarding Bank™<br> set is available on
                September 4th, or 1st September for LEGO VIPs!<br> Learn more over at the official website. But it'll be
                able to pre-order from 21st <br>August!</b><br>
