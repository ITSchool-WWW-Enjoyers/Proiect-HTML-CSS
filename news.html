                    have a
                    beautiful new book coming out, <br>looking back at over two decades<br> of behind-the-scenes
                    creations
                    across the Wizarding World. Let's take a look inside.<br>
                    Entitled The Magic of MinaLima: Celebrating the<br> Graphic Design Studio Behind the Harry Potter
                    &<br>
                    Fantastic Beasts Films, the design team's <br>latest publication goes<br> more personal than you've
                    seen
                    before, revealing a scrapbook of letters that the<br> designers sent to each other in the beginning,
                    alongside concept art<br> pieces and research documents that<br> would lead to some of the most
                    iconic props
                    in the Wizarding World stories.</p>

                <p class="tiket-info">Thousands of children across the UK were asked by Blue Peter to vote<br> for their
                    favourite Blue Peter Book Award winner of the past 20 years. The winner was revealed <br>today:
                    Harry
                    Potter's first adventure, Philosopher's Stone!
                    Blue Peter have been celebrating the best in children's literature since 2000, <br>and this year
                    marks
                    the 20th anniversary of the Blue Peter Book Award.

                    In recent years, this award usually has two forms: Best Story and Best Book with Facts. <br>For its
                    20th
                    anniversary, a new special category was put in place called 'Winner of Winners' with<br> Harry
                    Potter
                    joining a number of other prestigious titles in a carefully selected top ten: you<br> can see the
                    rest
                    of the top ten here.

                    Over 50 books have won a Blue Peter Book Award in the past two decades, so reading<br> charity
                    BookTrust
                    assembled a panel of experts to whittle<br> down a shortlist, with the results<nr></nr> being
                    decided upon by
                    Blue Peter's audience. On World Book Day, what an apt prize!.</p>

                <p class="tiket-info"> An exclusive first look at adorable new drawings of Harry Potter <br>characters,
                    coming soon to licensed products in Japan.
                    We can't get over these charming designs, which will soon feature on licensed products in Japan and
                    will then head to the rest of the world at the end of the year.

                    These new illustrations are the latest 'kawaii' style designs from Warner Bros., giving much-beloved
                    Harry Potter characters an adorable makeover. The style is simplified, without losing any of the
                    character. And we love that Malfoy still has his scowl.</p>
